# Time Series Analysis and Modelling

The initial step in time series analysis involves comprehending the data to ensure that the underlying assumptions necessary
for the mathematical and statistical methodologies are adequately met.

This repository will start with the fundamental concepts of time series analysis and will progressively develop in complexity. 
The following checklist will be revised and updated with the progression of the project:

- [ ] Data Exploration
  -  [ ] Basic Charts
  -  [ ] Data Distribution
  -  [ ] Auto Correlation
  -  [ ] Partial Auto Correlation
